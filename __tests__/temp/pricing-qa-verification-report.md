### ⚠️ Minor Issues Identified

#### 1. Component Detection Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Test selectors for `[class*="GradientText"]` and `[class*="NebulaBackground"]` return 0  
**Reality**: Components are present and functional (verified by visual inspection)  
**Impact**: Low - Affects test accuracy but not user experience  
**Root Cause**: React component class names transformed during build process

**Evidence of Actual Functionality:**
- Gradient text: `.bg-clip-text .text-transparent .bg-gradient-to-r` classes detected (2 elements)
- Background effects: `canvas` element detected (1 element) 
- Radial gradient backgrounds: 2 elements with `style*="radial-gradient"` detected
- Visual inspection confirms both gradient text and nebula background working

#### 2. Text Content Formatting Differences
**Issue**: Demo text includes whitespace/formatting, Next.js text is clean  
**Examples:**
- Demo title: `"\n                        Pricing\n                    "`
- Next.js title: `"Pricing"`
**Impact**: Minimal - Content identical, only formatting differs
**Status**: Expected behavior (React normalizes whitespace)
