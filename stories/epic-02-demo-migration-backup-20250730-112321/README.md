# Epic 02: Demo to Production Migration

**Epic Owner:** Alex (Architecture) & James (Development)  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Target Completion:** 6 weeks  
**Created:** 2025-01-30

## Epic Overview

This epic tracks the complete migration of the vybecoding demo (30+ HTML pages) to a production-ready Next.js application with pixel-perfect fidelity, improved architecture, and maintainable code.

## Business Value

- **Eliminate Technical Debt**: Replace 30+ CSS fix files with proper component architecture
- **Improve Performance**: Reduce bundle size by 65% through proper code organization
- **Enable Rapid Development**: Component-based architecture for faster feature delivery
- **Ensure Consistency**: Design system prevents style drift and conflicts
- **Production Ready**: Scalable foundation for platform growth

## Success Criteria

### Visual Fidelity ✅
- [ ] Every page matches demo pixel-perfectly at all breakpoints
- [ ] All animations match timing and easing exactly
- [ ] Colors, gradients, and shadows are identical
- [ ] Typography matches size, weight, and spacing

### Technical Quality ✅
- [ ] Zero CSS hacks or workarounds
- [ ] 100% TypeScript coverage
- [ ] Lighthouse score >90 on all pages
- [ ] WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- [ ] <2s page load time

### Architecture ✅
- [ ] All components use Shadcn/ui as base
- [ ] Proper use of Lucide icons throughout
- [ ] Design system with tokens implemented
- [ ] No direct DOM manipulation
- [ ] Server/client components properly separated

**Total Story Points:** 71

## Technical Approach

### 1. Component-First Migration
- Build reusable components before pages
- Use Shadcn/ui as foundation for all UI
- Implement design tokens for consistency
- Create compound components for flexibility

### 2. Visual Verification Process
- Side-by-side comparison with demo
- Playwright visual regression tests
- Manual verification checklist for each component
- TRAIL system captures all discrepancies

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with core functionality
- Add animations and effects after structure
- Optimize performance in final phase
- Maintain functionality at each step

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Style drift from demo | High | Visual verification at each step |
| Performance regression | Medium | Continuous Lighthouse monitoring |
| Accessibility issues | High | Built-in to Shadcn components |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari |

## Dependencies

- ✅ Next.js 15.4.4 with App Router
- ✅ Shadcn/ui component library
- ✅ Lucide React icons
- ✅ Tailwind CSS with custom config
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Clerk authentication
- ✅ Convex database

## BMAD Workflow

### Story Lifecycle
1. **Planning (SM)**: Story created with acceptance criteria
2. **Architecture Review (Architect)**: Technical approach validated
3. **Development (Dev)**: Implementation following story
4. **Visual Verification (QA)**: Pixel-perfect validation
5. **Documentation (Doc Writer)**: Component docs created

### Sub-Agent Responsibilities
- **bmad-sm**: Creates detailed stories with visual verification tasks
- **bmad-architect**: Reviews technical approach and patterns
- **bmad-dev**: Implements components and pages
- **bmad-qa**: Performs visual verification against demo
- **bmad-doc-writer**: Documents components and patterns
