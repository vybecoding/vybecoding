# DEMO-002: Design System Showcase Migration

**Epic:** Pixel-Perfect Demo Migration  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Created:** 2025-01-30  
**Demo Path:** `/design-system-showcase.html`  
**Next.js Route:** `/design-system`

## User Story

**As a** developer working on VybeCoding  
**I want** the design system showcase to be migrated to Next.js  
**So that** all component patterns and design tokens are properly documented and reusable

## Business Value

- **Component Library**: Establishes reusable component patterns
- **Design Consistency**: Single source of truth for all UI elements
- **Development Speed**: Enables rapid component development
- **Quality Assurance**: Visual reference for all other page migrations

## Demo Analysis

### Current Demo Features
- Comprehensive component showcase
- All card variations and badge styles
- Button states and form elements
- Typography scale demonstration
- Color palette with design tokens
- Grid and layout examples
- Accessibility patterns

### Key Components Showcased
- Card components (various styles)
- Badge components (all variants)
- Button components (all states)
- Form elements and inputs
- Navigation patterns
- Typography samples
- Color swatches and gradients

## Visual Verification Checklist

### Development Phase
- [ ] Demo showcase running on port 8080
- [ ] Next.js showcase running on port 3000 at `/design-system`
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison of each component section
- [ ] Real-device testing for responsive behavior

### Component-by-Component Verification
- [ ] Card components match exactly (spacing, borders, shadows)
- [ ] Badge components match colors and typography
- [ ] Button components match all states and animations
- [ ] Form elements match styling and focus states
- [ ] Typography samples match fonts, sizes, weights, line-heights
- [ ] Color swatches match hex values and gradients
- [ ] Layout grids match spacing and alignment

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Visual regression tests for each component section
- [ ] Screenshot comparison at multiple breakpoints
- [ ] Animation timing verification
- [ ] Color value verification (automated)

## Technical Implementation

```

### Design Token Implementation
- [ ] All demo colors imported to Tailwind config
- [ ] Custom CSS properties for gradients
- [ ] Typography scale configuration
- [ ] Spacing scale matching demo patterns
- [ ] Shadow utilities for card effects
- [ ] Animation timing utilities

## Story Completion Workflow

### Post-Development
1. **Component Verification**: Each component matches demo exactly
2. **Documentation Complete**: All components documented with usage
3. **Run Story Completion Workflow**: Execute `.claude/workflows/story-completion.md`
4. **Component Library Updated**: All components available for other stories

### Master Checklist Activation
After story completion workflow:
- [ ] All reusable components extracted and documented
- [ ] Design tokens properly configured in Tailwind
- [ ] Component usage guide created
- [ ] Accessibility patterns documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for components

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- ✅ Next.js 15.4.4 with App Router
- ✅ Shadcn/ui component library
- ✅ Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- ✅ Lucide React icons
- ⚠️ DEMO-001 components (Header, Footer, Layout)

### Design Dependencies
- ✅ Demo design system showcase running on port 8080
- ✅ Design tokens and patterns documented
- ✅ Component requirements from demo analysis

### Blocking Dependencies
- **DEMO-001**: Header and Footer components needed for layout

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Component complexity | Medium | Break into smaller, focused components |
| Design token conflicts | High | Carefully map demo tokens to Tailwind config |
| Shadcn/ui customization | Medium | Use composition over modification |
| Performance with many components | Low | Lazy loading for showcase sections |

## Notes

- This story creates the foundation component library for all other stories
- Priority should be on exact visual matching over optimization
- Document any design system improvements compared to demo inconsistencies
- All components should be production-ready, not just showcase examples
- Focus on reusability - these components will be used in all other stories

## Related Stories

**Dependencies:**
- DEMO-001: Home/Landing (for Header/Footer components)

**Stories that depend on this:**
- All other DEMO stories (will use these components)
- Especially DEMO-003 through DEMO-046 (content pages using cards, badges, buttons)

## Component Extraction Plan

### Phase 1: Core UI Components
- Card variants (gradient, glass, standard)
- Badge variants (all colors and styles)
- Button variants (primary, secondary, ghost, etc.)

### Phase 2: Layout Components
- Grid systems matching demo
- Container components
- Spacing utilities

### Phase 3: Specialized Components
