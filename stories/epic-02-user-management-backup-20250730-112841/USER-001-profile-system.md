## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Extensions

```typescript
// Extend existing users table in convex/schema.ts
users: defineTable({
  // Existing fields...
  clerkId: v.string(),
  email: v.string(),
  firstName: v.optional(v.string()),
  lastName: v.optional(v.string()),
  
  // New profile fields
  displayName: v.optional(v.string()),
  bio: v.optional(v.string()),
  avatar: v.optional(v.string()), // URL to uploaded image
  location: v.optional(v.string()),
  website: v.optional(v.string()),
  github: v.optional(v.string()),
  linkedin: v.optional(v.string()),
  twitter: v.optional(v.string()),
  skills: v.array(v.string()), // Array of technology tags
  profileVisibility: v.union(
    v.literal("public"),
    v.literal("private"),
    v.literal("members-only")
  ),
  isProfileComplete: v.boolean(),
  profileCompletedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  lastActiveAt: v.number(),
})
.index("by_display_name", ["displayName"])
.index("by_skills", ["skills"])
```

### API Endpoints Required

```typescript
// convex/users.ts additions
export const updateUserProfile = mutation({...});
export const getUserProfile = query({...});
export const getUserPublicProfile = query({...});
export const uploadProfileAvatar = mutation({...});
export const searchUsersBySkills = query({...});
```
