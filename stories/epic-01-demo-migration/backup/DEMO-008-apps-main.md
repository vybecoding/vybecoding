2. **Universal Search Bar** with purple submit button
3. **Multi-Select Category Filter** with all categories from demo
4. **Sort By Dropdown** with multiple sorting options
5. **Apps Grid** with card components matching demo

### Key Features

- Background changed from nebula to solid black
- Multi-category selection with visual pills
- Proper hover states and transitions
- Integration with Convex for real app data

The implementation in DEMO-003 fully covers the requirements of DEMO-008, as they represent the same page functionality.
