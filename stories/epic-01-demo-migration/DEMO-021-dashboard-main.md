# DEMO-021: Dashboard Home Page Migration

**Epic:** Pixel-Perfect Demo Migration  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Status:** Completed  
**Created:** 2025-01-30  
**Demo Path:** `/pages/dashboard.html`  
**Next.js Route:** `/dashboard`

## User Story

**As a** logged-in user of VybeCoding  
**I want** the dashboard home page to match the demo exactly  
**So that** I have the same dashboard experience and functionality as the original demo

## Business Value

- **User Engagement**: Dashboard is the primary user landing page after login
- **Feature Discovery**: Showcases platform capabilities and user progress
- **Navigation Hub**: Central access point to all platform features
- **User Retention**: Personalized dashboard increases platform stickiness

## Demo Analysis

### Current Demo Features
- Welcome header with user greeting
- Statistics cards (apps submitted, guides created, etc.)
- Recent activity feed
- Quick action buttons (create app, write guide, etc.)
- Navigation sidebar (when expanded)
- Responsive layout with mobile-optimized sidebar

### Visual Elements
- Dashboard-specific gradient backgrounds
- Stat cards with icons and numbers
- Activity timeline with timestamps
- Action buttons with hover effects
- Sidebar navigation with active states
- Mobile hamburger menu integration

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Fidelity
- [ ] Dashboard layout matches demo exactly at all breakpoints

- [ ] All links navigate correctly

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Playwright visual tests pass (<2% diff)
- [ ] Authentication redirect tests pass
- [ ] Mobile responsive tests pass
- [ ] Navigation functionality tests pass

## Technical Implementation

### Page Structure
```
app/dashboard/
├── page.tsx              # Dashboard home component
├── layout.tsx            # Dashboard layout with sidebar
├── components/
│   ├── Sidebar.tsx       # Navigation sidebar
│   ├── StatsCard.tsx     # Statistics display cards
│   ├── ActivityFeed.tsx  # Recent activity component
│   ├── QuickActions.tsx  # Quick action buttons
│   └── WelcomeHeader.tsx # User greeting section
└── loading.tsx           # Loading state for dashboard
```

### Authentication Integration
```tsx
// app/dashboard/page.tsx
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const { userId } = auth()
  
  if (!userId) {
    redirect('/sign-in')
  }
  
  // Dashboard content...
}
```

### Component Reuse
- **Header/Footer**: From DEMO-001
- **Card variants**: From DEMO-002
- **Button variants**: From DEMO-002
- **Badge components**: From DEMO-002

### Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Sidebar collapses to hamburger menu on mobile
- [ ] Statistics cards stack vertically on small screens
- [ ] Activity feed maintains usability on mobile
- [ ] Touch interactions work correctly
- [ ] Mobile navigation drawer functions smoothly

## Story Completion Workflow

### Post-Development
1. **Authentication Testing**: Login flow and protected routes verified
2. **Visual Verification**: All layout elements match demo exactly
3. **Run Story Completion Workflow**: Execute `.claude/workflows/story-completion.md`
4. **Performance Audit**: Dashboard loading performance verified

### Master Checklist Activation
After story completion workflow:
- [ ] Dashboard layout pattern documented
- [ ] Authentication integration pattern recorded
- [ ] Sidebar component available for other dashboard pages
- [ ] Statistics card pattern available for reuse
- [ ] Mobile navigation pattern documented

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- ✅ Next.js 15.4.4 with App Router
- ✅ Clerk authentication integration
- ✅ Shadcn/ui component library
- ⚠️ DEMO-001 components (Header, Footer)
- ⚠️ DEMO-002 components (Cards, Buttons, Badges)

### Design Dependencies
- ✅ Demo dashboard accessible at port 8080
- ✅ Dashboard layout patterns documented

### Blocking Dependencies
- **DEMO-001**: Header and Footer components required
- **DEMO-002**: Card, Button, and Badge components required

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Authentication complexity | Medium | Use established Clerk patterns, test thoroughly |
| Sidebar responsive behavior | Medium | Progressive enhancement, mobile-first approach |
| Performance with real user data | Low | Start with mock data, optimize data fetching later |
| Component dependency management | Low | Ensure DEMO-001 and DEMO-002 complete first |

## Mock Data Requirements

### User Statistics
```typescript
interface UserStats {
  appsSubmitted: number
  guidesCreated: number
  totalViews: number
  communityRank: number
}
```

### Activity Feed
```typescript
interface ActivityItem {
  id: string
  type: 'app' | 'guide' | 'comment' | 'like'
  title: string
  timestamp: Date
  description?: string
}
```

## Notes

- Dashboard requires proper authentication - ensure Clerk integration works
- Focus on matching the exact layout and spacing from demo
- Statistics can use mock data initially - real data integration comes later
- Sidebar component will be reused in other dashboard pages
- Mobile experience is critical - test on real devices
