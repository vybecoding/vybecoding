# vybecoding Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the optimal order for implementing features, with clear guidance on when to add each service or component.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Basic Next.js app with authentication and database

### Already Completed:
- [x] Next.js setup with TypeScript
- [x] Convex database integration
- [x] Clerk authentication
- [x] Basic routing structure
- [x] Middleware for protected routes

## Phase 2: Payment Infrastructure (Week 2) ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Enable monetization

### Already Completed:
- [x] Stripe integration
- [x] Checkout flow
- [x] Webhook handlers
- [x] Subscription management
- [x] Customer portal

## Phase 3: Core Features (Weeks 3-4) 🚧 CURRENT PHASE
**Goal**: Build the MVP features that make your platform unique

### To Build:
1. **Member Profiles**
   - Profile creation/editing
   - Public profile pages
   - Skills/expertise tags
   - Portfolio/work samples

2. **App Showcase**
   - App submission flow
   - App detail pages
   - Categories and search
   - Featured apps section

3. **Content/Guides System**
   - Guide creation (markdown/rich text)
   - Free vs premium content
   - Reading progress tracking
   - Comments/feedback

### ⚠️ DO NOT IMPLEMENT CAL.COM YET
**Why wait?**: You need to know:
- What types of services members will offer
- Pricing models (hourly, project, retainer)
- Whether you need booking at all (maybe it's project-based)

## Phase 4: Communication (Week 5)
**Goal**: Enable user interactions

### To Build:
1. **Messaging System** (Choose one):
   - Option A: Simple contact forms → Resend emails
   - Option B: In-app messaging with Convex
   - Option C: Integration with Discord/Slack

2. **Notifications**
   - Email notifications (Resend) ✅ Ready
   - In-app notifications
   - Preference management

## Phase 5: Booking System (Week 6) 📅 CAL.COM INTEGRATION POINT
**Goal**: Enable appointments/consultations

### Decision Point: Do You Need Booking?
Ask yourself:
- Are members offering time-based services?
- Do they need calendar scheduling?
- Is it appointments or project-based work?

### If YES to Booking:

#### Option A: Minimal Custom Booking (1-2 days)
```typescript
// Simple availability display
const MemberAvailability = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Available Times</h3>
      <p>Monday-Friday: 9am-5pm EST</p>
      <button>Contact to Schedule</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Option B: Cal.com Atoms Integration (3-5 days)
```bash
# Install Cal.com components
npm install @calcom/atoms @calcom/ui

# Use their components with your data
```

#### Option C: Full Booking System (1-2 weeks)
- Calendar view
- Time slot selection
- Booking confirmation
- Calendar sync
- Rescheduling

### Implementation Guide:
1. **Start with member settings**:
   ```typescript
   // convex/schema.ts
   memberSettings: defineTable({
     userId: v.string(),
     acceptsBookings: v.boolean(),
     hourlyRate: v.optional(v.number()),
     consultationTypes: v.array(v.object({
       name: v.string(),
       duration: v.number(),
       price: v.number(),
     })),
   })
   ```

2. **Add booking UI only for members who enable it**
3. **Integrate payments with existing Stripe setup**

## Phase 6: Search & Discovery (Week 7)
**Goal**: Help users find members/content

### To Build:
- Advanced search with filters
- Recommendation engine
- Tags and categories
- Featured content algorithms

## Phase 7: Analytics & Reporting (Week 8)
**Goal**: Provide insights to members

### To Build:
- Member dashboards
- Earning reports
- Traffic analytics
- Engagement metrics

## Phase 8: Production Deployment (Week 9)
**Goal**: Launch to real users

### Steps:
1. **Deploy to Vercel** (Post-MVP) ⏳
2. **Set up Umami Analytics** (Post-MVP) ⏳
3. **Enable Sentry in production** ✅ Ready
4. **Configure custom domain**
5. **Set up monitoring**

## Phase 9: Scale & Optimize (Week 10+)
**Goal**: Handle growth

### Consider:
- **CDN for assets**
- **Postal** for email (when > 100k/month)
- **Cal.com self-hosted** (if booking becomes core feature)
- **Background job processing**
- **Caching layer**

## Decision Tree for Cal.com

```
Does your platform need booking?
├─ NO → Skip Cal.com entirely
└─ YES → How important is booking?
    ├─ Nice to have → Simple contact form
    ├─ Important → Cal.com Atoms (free)
    └─ Core feature → Consider:
        ├─ < 50 members → Cal.com Teams ($600/mo)
        ├─ 50-500 members → Self-host Cal.com
        └─ 500+ members → Custom solution
```

## Key Principles

1. **Build features only when needed**
2. **Start simple, iterate based on feedback**
3. **Don't over-engineer early**
4. **Use existing services until you outgrow them**
5. **Defer complex features until post-launch**

## Current Status (January 2025)

- ✅ Foundation complete
- ✅ Payments ready
- ✅ Email service ready
- 🚧 Building core features
- ⏳ Booking system (wait for user feedback)
- ⏳ Deployment (wait for MVP)

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Define your core value proposition
2. Build member profiles
3. Create app/content showcase
4. Get feedback from potential users
5. THEN decide on booking needs
