# Documentation Update Summary - January 28, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the documentation updates made to reflect the current state of the vybecoding project, particularly the BMAD Method v4.33.0 integration with Claude Code sub-agents.

## Major Changes

### 1. BMAD Method + Claude Code Sub-Agents Integration
- Installed BMAD Method v4.33.0 with Infrastructure DevOps expansion pack
- Created 6 BMAD sub-agents in `.claude/agents/` directory:

  - `bmad-sm.md` - Story Management (Stella)
  - `bmad-qa.md` - Quality Assurance (Quinn)
  - `bmad-po.md` - Product Owner (Olivia)
  - `bmad-architect.md` - Architecture (Alex)
  - `bmad-doc-writer.md` - Documentation (Dana)
- Removed references to non-functional orchestration features
- Updated to reflect realistic Claude Code sub-agent architecture

### 2. Documentation Files Updated

#### README.md
- Updated project structure to show `.claude/agents/` directory
- Added BMAD sub-agents to the feature list
- Included `.bmad-core/` and `.bmad-infrastructure-devops/` in structure
- Clarified BMAD agents are available as both slash commands and sub-agents

#### CLAUDE.md (v2.2)
- Added comprehensive BMAD sub-agent integration section
- Listed all available BMAD agents with their sub-agent names
- Explained automatic delegation and context isolation
- Updated version from 2.1 to 2.2

#### PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

- Added BMAD Method directories section
- Updated to reflect current project structure

#### docs/setup.md
- Updated BMAD Method entry to mention sub-agent integration
- Changed from listing individual commands to "Slash commands + Claude Code sub-agents"

#### docs/tech-stack.md
- Expanded BMAD integration section to explain sub-agents
- Added details about auto-delegation and context isolation
- Kept existing setup instructions

#### docs/commands.md
- Reorganized BMAD commands into Core Agent Commands and Task Commands
- Added note that agents are available as sub-agents
- Listed additional task commands
- Fixed duplicate utility commands section

#### docs/bmad/sub-agents-integration.md (NEW)
- Created comprehensive guide for BMAD + Claude Code integration
- Explained information flow and architecture
- Listed all available sub-agents with descriptions
- Provided common workflows and best practices

## Key Concepts Documented

1. **Sub-Agent Architecture**: Claude Code acts as primary agent, delegating to BMAD sub-agents
2. **Context Isolation**: Each sub-agent has its own clean context window
3. **Automatic Delegation**: Claude Code selects appropriate agent based on task
4. **Tool Specialization**: Each agent only has access to relevant tools
5. **TRAIL Integration**: All sub-agents work with the solution learning system

## Removed/Corrected

- Removed references to "enhanced" agents (dev-enhanced, sm-enhanced)
- Removed orchestration and parallel execution claims
- Removed "3x faster" claims (changed to "2x faster" where appropriate)
- Removed bmad-master and bmad-orchestrator as they're not needed with Claude Code

## File Locations

- Sub-agents: `.claude/agents/bmad-*.md`
- BMAD Core: `.bmad-core/`
- DevOps Pack: `.bmad-infrastructure-devops/`
- Commands: `.claude/commands/BMad/`
- Documentation: `docs/bmad/sub-agents-integration.md`

## Next Steps

1. Test sub-agent delegation in practice
2. Monitor sub-agent performance and usage
3. Create additional specialized sub-agents as needed
4. Update documentation as integration evolves

This update ensures all documentation accurately reflects the realistic integration of BMAD Method with Claude Code's native sub-agent system.
