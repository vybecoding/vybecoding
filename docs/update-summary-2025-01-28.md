### 4. Current Correct Structure

```
.claude/
├── settings.json          # Hook configurations (NOT in config/)
├── hooks/                 # All hook scripts (NOT in config/hooks/)
├── config/               
│   └── mcp-settings.json  # MCP server settings (stays in config)
├── solutions/             # TRAIL system
├── agents/                # Sub-agents
└── commands/              # Slash commands
```

### 5. Verification

All references have been verified and corrected. No remaining incorrect paths found in:
- Markdown files (*.md)
- JSON files (*.json)
- Shell scripts (*.sh)

The consolidation.md file has been marked as archived since it contains outdated migration information.

## Impact

These changes ensure all documentation accurately reflects the current file structure and follows Claude Code's standard conventions for settings file placement.
