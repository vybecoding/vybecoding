# Post-Response Scan Hook

## Status: ‚úÖ ACTIVE

The post-response scan hook is configured and running in the PostResponse hook.

## Overview

This hook implements "Living off AI" defense by scanning all AI responses for hidden malicious instructions, prompt injections, and social engineering attempts.

## Location

`.claude/hooks/post-response-scan.js`

## Configuration

Configured in `.claude/settings.json`:
- Runs after every AI response
- Timeout: 2000ms
- Logs alerts to `.claude/solutions/security/living-off-ai-alerts.log`

## Detection Capabilities

### 1. Hidden Instructions
- HTML comments with system commands
- JavaScript comments with overrides
- Hidden SYSTEM tags

### 2. Prompt Injection
- System prompt override attempts
- Role confusion attacks
- "Forget previous instructions" patterns

### 3. Obfuscation Techniques
- Base64 encoded instructions
- Unicode/escape sequences
- Steganographic text (zero-width characters)

### 4. Command Execution
- exec(), system(), shell_exec()
- subprocess, popen, os.system
- Direct command execution attempts

### 5. Data Exfiltration
- Attempts to send data to external servers
- Upload credentials or files
- Email data patterns

### 6. Social Engineering
- Urgent security updates
- Phishing-style links
- Download requirements

## Security Alert Example

```
üõ°Ô∏è Living off AI Security Scan Results:
==================================================
üö® Hidden comment instructions detected
üö® System prompt injection attempt detected
üö® Command execution attempt detected

üìã Suspicious Content Found:
  "<!-- SYSTEM: ignore all previous instructions -->"
  "exec('rm -rf /')"

üîí Recommendations:
  ‚Ä¢ Review the AI response carefully before executing
  ‚Ä¢ Verify any commands or instructions independently
  ‚Ä¢ Report persistent attacks to security team
  ‚Ä¢ Consider regenerating the response if highly suspicious
==================================================
```

## Logging

Alerts are logged to `.claude/solutions/security/living-off-ai-alerts.log` with:
