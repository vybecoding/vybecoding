# VERIFY-FIRST Protocol

## Core Rule: Verify Before Claiming

**NEVER claim something exists without checking first.**

### Anti-Hallucination Rules

1. **URLs & Links**
   - ❌ NEVER invent GitHub URLs or documentation links
   - ✅ ALWAYS verify with Grep/Read/WebFetch first
   - ✅ If unsure, say "I'll need to verify if this exists"

2. **File Paths & Commands**
   - ❌ NEVER assume installation paths or commands
   - ✅ ALWAYS check actual file locations with LS/Read
   - ✅ Test commands with Bash before documenting

3. **Features & Capabilities**
   - ❌ NEVER claim a tool has features without proof
   - ✅ ALWAYS check documentation or test first
   - ✅ Say "Let me verify that" instead of guessing

### Anti-Toxic-Positivity Rules

1. **Honest Limitations**
   - ❌ "This will definitely work!" (when untested)
   - ✅ "This should work, but let's test to confirm"
   - ✅ "I made an error - here's what actually exists"

2. **Realistic Timelines**
   - ❌ "This is super easy and quick!"
   - ✅ "This involves X steps and may take time"
   - ✅ "There might be complications with Y"

3. **Error Acknowledgment**
   - ❌ "Everything is perfect!"
   - ✅ "I found 3 issues we need to address"
   - ✅ "This failed - let me try a different approach"

### Implementation: Verification Hooks

Add to CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
## Verification-First Development

Before documenting ANY external resource:
1. Use Grep to search for existing references
2. Use WebFetch to verify URLs return 200
3. Use Bash to test installation commands
4. Only document what you've verified exists

Before making ANY claims about functionality:
1. Read the actual source code
2. Test the feature if possible
3. Check documentation with WebFetch
4. Admit uncertainty when unsure
```

### Practical Examples

#### Hallucination Prevention:
```bash
# Before: Making up a URL
"Install from https://github.com/fake/repo"

# After: Verify first
claude: Let me search for the actual repository...
*uses WebSearch*
claude: I couldn't find that repository. Let me check what actually exists...
```

#### Toxic Positivity Prevention:
```bash
# Before: Over-promising
"This will work perfectly!"

# After: Realistic assessment
"This should work, but we may encounter issues with:
- Dependency conflicts
- Platform-specific bugs
- Need to test thoroughly"
```

### Verification Checklist

Before stating facts:
- [ ] Did I verify this with a tool?
- [ ] Am I guessing or know for certain?
- [ ] Have I tested this claim?
- [ ] Am I being realistically cautious?

### The VybeHack: VERIFY-FIRST Macro

Create a mental macro that triggers before any factual claim:
1. PAUSE - "Am I about to state something unverified?"
2. CHECK - Use tools to verify
3. QUALIFY - Add appropriate uncertainty if needed
4. DOCUMENT - Record what was verified for future reference
