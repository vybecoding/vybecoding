# BMAD Demo Migration Audit Report

**Generated:** July 30, 2025  
**Audit Method:** Playwright Visual Verification with BMAD Workflow Integration

## Executive Summary

The audit reveals that while the demo site is fully functional with all pages implemented, **the Next.js migration has not yet begun**. All 7 critical pages need to be implemented following the pixel-perfect requirements outlined in the demo-migration-plan.md.

### Key Findings:
- **0/7 pages migrated** (0% implementation)
- **Demo site fully functional** (100% ready as reference)
- **Visual fidelity score: 13%** (base infrastructure only)
- **All demo pages accessible** for pixel-perfect reference

### Visual Components Audit

Based on the demo-migration-plan.md requirements, these components need implementation:

#### 1. **Design System Foundation** (Not Started)
- [ ] Tailwind configuration with vybe color palette
- [ ] Gradient text component (`from-vybe-purple via-vybe-pink to-vybe-orange`)
- [ ] Glassmorphism effects (blur: 12px)
- [ ] Animation system (fade-in, slide-up, gentle-bounce)

#### 2. **Core UI Components** (Not Started)
- [ ] Navigation with glassmorphism and mobile menu
- [ ] AppCard with featured badge positioning
- [ ] GuideCard with date corner design
- [ ] MemberCard with avatar and social links
- [ ] Hero sections with nebula backgrounds

#### 3. **Layout Systems** (Not Started)
- [ ] Dashboard layout with tab navigation
- [ ] Responsive grid systems (3-col desktop, 1-col mobile)
- [ ] Page containers with proper spacing
- [ ] Loading skeletons for all content types

## BMAD Workflow Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

**Agent: bmad-architect**
- Review demo architecture and create technical design
- Define component hierarchy and reusable patterns
- Establish coding standards for pixel-perfect implementation

**Agent: bmad-sm**
- Create STORY-001: Design System and Base Components
- Create STORY-002: Navigation Component
- Define detailed verification tasks for each story

**Agent: bmad-dev**
- Implement design tokens and Tailwind configuration
- Create base component library structure
- Port gradient and glassmorphism effects

**Agent: bmad-qa**
- Verify color accuracy against demo
- Test responsive breakpoints (375px, 768px, 1440px)
- Validate animation timings

### Phase 2: Core Pages (Week 2-3)

**Priority Order (following user journey):**
1. Landing Page (first touchpoint)
2. Navigation (enables exploration)
3. Apps Browse (content discovery)
4. Guides Browse (more content)
5. Auth Pages (user registration)

**For each page:**
- bmad-sm: Create detailed story with visual verification tasks
- bmad-dev: Implement following pixel-perfect specs
- bmad-qa: Run Playwright visual tests
- bmad-doc-writer: Document component APIs

### Phase 3: Dashboard & Profiles (Week 4)

**Complex Features:**
- Dashboard with nested routing
- Profile pages with booking integration
- Settings with multi-tab layout

### Phase 4: Polish & Production (Week 5)

**Final Tasks:**
- Performance optimization (target >90 Lighthouse)
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility compliance
- Error boundary implementation

## Playwright Test Suite Details

The comprehensive test suite created includes:

### Test Coverage
- **8 test files** covering all major pages
- **Visual comparison helpers** for pixel-perfect validation
- **Responsive testing** at all required breakpoints
- **Interaction testing** for hover states and animations
- **Accessibility audits** built into each test

### Test Infrastructure

```

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. **Start with Design System** (Today)
```bash
# Use bmad-sm to create first story
/sm Create STORY-001 for design system setup with Tailwind config and base components

# Then implement with bmad-dev
/dev Implement STORY-001 following demo design tokens
```

### 2. **Set Up Visual Testing** (This Week)
```bash
# Install Playwright if not already installed
npm install -D @playwright/test

# Run visual tests after each implementation
cd __tests__/visual-verification && ./run-visual-tests.sh
```

### 3. **Follow TRAIL Learning** (Continuous)
- Each visual mismatch gets logged to TRAIL
- Apply learned patterns to prevent repeated issues
- Build institutional knowledge of demo quirks

## Success Metrics

Track progress using these KPIs:

1. **Implementation Progress**: 0/7 pages → 7/7 pages
2. **Visual Fidelity Score**: 13% → >90%
3. **Test Pass Rate**: Track via Playwright reports
4. **TRAIL Patterns**: Number of learned solutions

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Begin immediately** with design system implementation
2. **Use demo as single source of truth** for all visual decisions
3. **Run visual tests after every component** to catch drift early
4. **Document design decisions** in component files

### Process Improvements
1. **Daily visual regression tests** during migration
2. **Component showcase page** to verify in isolation
3. **Side-by-side comparison setup** for development
4. **Automated screenshot capture** for documentation

## Conclusion

The migration hasn't started yet, but all prerequisites are in place:
- Demo site is fully functional as reference
- Comprehensive test suite ready for validation
- Clear implementation roadmap in demo-migration-plan.md
- BMAD agents configured for efficient workflow

**Next Step:** Begin with STORY-001 (Design System) using the bmad-sm agent to create detailed implementation tasks with visual verification checkpoints.
